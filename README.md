# Team_FLEMINGO - Community-Driven Pollution Awareness Website

Solution for pollution(air, water and soil) using technology and raising awareness among the people.

Our project is an effective way to tackle the problems of pollution by including a feature where the people themselves can report the location by clicking and uploading the photo, into our website, by specifiying the location of pollution, choosing the category of pollution(air, water or soil) and then provide a short description too if needed. Our website uses machine learning to classify those reported or uploaded photos into low, medium, high severity of pollution( For now we have only focused on water pollution). After reporting, a heatmap is displayed based on the reported places and this heatmap can be used by various environmental activists or NSS units, so that they can keep a priority and can tackle the problem of pollution.
